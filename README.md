# Mapping-Percent-to-Rectangle-length
A program that will map the length of two rectangles meant to represent percentage bars to the number of "votes" each rectangle received.

This was meant to be a protoype to a "voting" website where users would vote on two or more subjects, and rectangles would re shape themselves accordingly to represent the percentage of votes for one section against the total number of votes.
